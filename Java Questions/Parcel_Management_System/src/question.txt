Excellent 👏 — now that’s an important clarification!

You want the “location” in your Parcel Management System to represent a 2D array position — for example, something like a warehouse grid or map where each parcel is stored at coordinates (row, column).

Let’s revise your OOP Lab Paper in Java accordingly 👇

💻 OOP Lab Exam Paper (Java)

Question: Parcel Management System with 2D Location Tracking

Total Marks: 20  Time: 2 hours  Language: Java


---

Problem Statement:

You are required to design a Parcel Management System using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.
Each parcel is stored in a 2D warehouse grid (rows and columns).
The system should manage parcel information, location in the grid, delivery status, and price.


---

Requirements:

1. Class Design

Class: Parcel

Data Members:

int parcelID

String senderName

String receiverName

int row — parcel’s row position in the 2D array

int col — parcel’s column position in the 2D array

double weight

double price

boolean isDelivered


Member Functions:

void inputData() – take parcel details and location (row, col) from user.

void calculatePrice() – price = weight × 250.

void displayData() – display all parcel details (including grid position).

void markDelivered() – change status to delivered.




---

Class: ParcelSystem

Data Members:

Parcel[][] parcels = new Parcel[5][5]; // 5×5 warehouse grid

int totalParcels = 0;


Member Functions:

void addParcel() – add a new parcel to a specific grid cell (row, col).

If that cell already contains a parcel, show “Slot occupied.”


void searchParcelByID(int id) – find parcel by ID anywhere in grid.

void searchParcelByLocation(int row, int col) – show parcel details at given grid coordinates.

void markDeliveredByID(int id) – mark parcel as delivered using its ID.

void displayAllParcels() – display all non-null parcels with their positions.




---

Class: Main

Implement a menu-driven program with the following options:

1. Add a new parcel


2. Search parcel by ID


3. Search parcel by grid location


4. Mark parcel as delivered


5. Display all parcels


6. Exit





---

OOP Concepts to Apply

Encapsulation: Keep class variables private.

Composition: Store Parcel objects in a 2D array inside ParcelSystem.

Abstraction: User interacts only through clear menu options.

Polymorphism (Optional): Could be used later if different parcel types are introduced (e.g., ExpressParcel).

Expected Output (Example)

===== Parcel Management System =====
1. Add Parcel
2. Search by ID
3. Search by Location
4. Mark Delivered
5. Display All
6. Exit

Enter choice: 1
Enter Parcel ID: 101
Sender Name: Ali
Receiver Name: Ahmed
Row: 1
Column: 2
Weight: 3.5
Parcel added at (1, 2)
Price: 875.0 PKR

Enter choice: 5
ID: 101 | Sender: Ali | Receiver: Ahmed | Location: (1,2) | Delivered: false | Price: 875.0

Marking Criteria

Section	Marks

Class Structure & Encapsulation	5
2D Array Implementation	5
Functionality (Add, Search, Mark, Display)	6
Code Quality & Readability	2
Output Accuracy	2

Would you like me to now write the Java solution code for this updated version (with the 2D array location system)?
